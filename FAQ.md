 **What exactly is a microadventure?**<br>
 Well, there is no clear answer to that, microadventures are very diverse. But in the past we have spent a day hunting orchids in the mountains, went on a via ferrata or helped another microadventurer with their research by catching bats for one evening ;)

 **How physically tough are the microadventures?**<br>
 All microadventures are a little different. Some are super strenuous, others are relaxing. It depends. However, we cathegorize the microadventures according to the physical rigor you can expect: easy, moderate, and hard. This information can be found in the description of each microadventure.

 **I have a wish for a microadventure topic, can I suggest it?**<br>
 Absolutely! We will do out best to organize something and we are always happy for suggestions and ideas.

 **I would like to organise a microadventure, can I?**<br>
 That's g-r-e-a-t! Yes, anyone can do it, but we suggest having been on at least one microexcursion to get a rough feel for what it's like.
