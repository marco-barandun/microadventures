 **What exactly is a microadventure?**<br>
 Well, there is no clear answer, microadventures are very diverse. However, in the past we have been chasing orchids for a day in the mountains, we went on a via ferrata or we helped fellow microadventurers in their research by catching some bats... ;)
 
 **How physically tough are the microadventures?**<br>
 All microadventures are a bit different. Some are super tough, other ones are relaxed (e.g. walks). It depends. However, we cathegorize the microadventures based on their expected physical toughness: easy ones, moderate ones and hard ones. You will find this information in the description of the microaadventure.

 **I have a wish for a microadventure topic, can I suggest it?**<br>
 Absolutely! We will do out best to organise something and we are always happy for suggestions and ideas.
 
 **I would like to organise a microadventure, can I?**<br>
 This is g-r-e-a-t! Yes, you can, anyone can, however we suggest to have been to at least one microexcursion, just to have a rough feeling of how it is.
