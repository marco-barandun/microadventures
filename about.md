We are a group of nature-loving people who want to explore this planet we have. However, most of us, and you probably too, are busy with our lives. This is how the idea of microadventures was born: beautiful and interesting adventures at a micro level!

The idea started with a few enthusiastic ecologists focused on seeing a particularly rare bird or identifying a strange plant. In this way, we saw many places that were bursting with awesomeness! Some were even very close to cities.... So we thought, why not include our non-ecologist friends in these trips? They might be interested in the beauty of nature too! So, even if we will reveal an ecological fact from time to time, we will keep it at a comfortable level for everyone ;)
