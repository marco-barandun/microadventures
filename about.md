 We are a group of nature loving people which want to go out and explore this planet we have. Most of us, and you propably too, are however busy with their lifes. So, the idea of microadventures was generated: beautiful and  interesting adventures at a micro level!

The idea started with a few enthusiastic ecologists focussing on seeing that ultra rare bird or identifying that weird plant. By doing so we saw many places that were simply dripping full of awesomeness! Some were even pretty near to cities... So we tought, hey why not include also our non-ecologists-friends in these trips? They might be interested in the beatuty of nature too! So, even though we will every now and then dispense an ecology fact, we will keep it to a pleasant-for-everybody level ;)
