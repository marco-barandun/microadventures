During this excurion we will go and visit an **iconic** peatbog in the Z체rich area. These landscapes were common in Switzerland and in particular in the area of Z체rich, however now less than 5% of this precious habitat is still present in Switzerland. There will be plenty of opportunities to talk about and see carnivorous plants and we might exchange some carnivorous plants.
This is a good opportunity for an chilled spring afternoon walk.
